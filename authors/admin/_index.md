I am a Ph.D. student at Huazhong Agricultural University (HZAU), China, with research interests in bioinformatics data analysis and software development. My current work focuses on single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics data analysis, as well as applications in neurobiology and immunology.

During my Ph.D., I participated in a visiting research program at the University of New South Wales (UNSW), where I expanded my expertise in epigenomics, including ATAC-seq and CUT&RUN data analysis, and gained experience applying deep learning techniques to biological data.
