title: Single-cell transcriptome landscape and antigen receptor dynamic during SARS-CoV-2 vaccination
abstract: Vaccination by inactivated vaccine is an effective strategy to prevent the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the detailed molecular immune response at single-cell level is poorly understood. In this study, we systematically delineated the landscape of the pre- and post-vaccination single-cell transcriptome, TCR (T cell antigen receptor) and BCR (B cell antigen receptor) expression profile of vaccinated candidates. The bulk TCR sequencing analysis of COVID-19 patients was also performed. Enrichment of a clonal CD8+ T cell cluster expressing specific TCR was identified in both vaccination candidates and COVID-19 patients. These clonal CD8+ T cells showed high expression of cytotoxicity, phagosome and antigen presentation related genes. The cell–cell interaction analysis revealed that monocytes and dendritic cells could interact with these cells and initiate phagocytosis via ICAM1-ITGAM and ITGB2 signaling. Together, our study systematically deciphered the detailed immunological response during SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and infection. It may facilitate understanding the immune response and the T-cell therapy against COVID-19.
