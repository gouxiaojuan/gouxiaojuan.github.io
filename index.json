Using single-cell spatial transcriptomic analysis and single-nucleus RNA sequencing, we obtained transcriptome-based atlases for the macaque, marmoset, and mouse hippocampus. Cross-species comparison revealed primate- and lamina-specific glutamatergic cell types in the subicular complex, as well as enrichment of VIP-expressing GABAergic cells from mice to primates, including humans. Furthermore, we found reduced transcriptomic differences between CA3 and CA4 subregions and distinct longitudinal distributions of various cell types and expression of ion-channel genes, correlated with differences in electrophysiological properties of CA3, CA4, and CA1 neurons revealed by slice recording from marmosets and mice. Collectively, this cross-species study provides a molecular and cellular basis for understanding the evolution and function of the hippocampus.","tags":null,"title":"Evolutionary convergence and divergence of hippocampal cytoarchitecture between rodents and primates revealed by single-cell spatial transcriptomics","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xiaojian Cao","Xiaohua Chen","Yaqi Zhu","Xiaojuan Gou","Keyi Yan","Bing Yang","Dong Men","Lei Liu","Yong-an Zhang","Prof.Gang Cao"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1689724800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1689724800,"objectID":"972a3646400134eeb3a352e48a792da5","permalink":"https://gouxiaojuan.github.io/publication/single-cell-transcriptome-landscape-and-antigen-receptor-dynamic-during-sars-cov-2-vaccination/","publishdate":"2023-07-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/single-cell-transcriptome-landscape-and-antigen-receptor-dynamic-during-sars-cov-2-vaccination/","section":"publication","summary":"Vaccination by inactivated vaccine is an effective strategy to prevent the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the detailed molecular immune response at single-cell level is poorly understood. In this study, we systematically delineated the landscape of the pre- and post-vaccination single-cell transcriptome, TCR (T cell antigen receptor) and BCR (B cell antigen receptor) expression profile of vaccinated candidates. The bulk TCR sequencing analysis of COVID-19 patients was also performed. Enrichment of a clonal CD8+ T cell cluster expressing specific TCR was identified in both vaccination candidates and COVID-19 patients. These clonal CD8+ T cells showed high expression of cytotoxicity, phagosome and antigen presentation related genes. The cell–cell interaction analysis revealed that monocytes and dendritic cells could interact with these cells and initiate phagocytosis via ICAM1-ITGAM and ITGB2 signaling. Together, our study systematically deciphered the detailed immunological response during SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and infection. It may facilitate understanding the immune response and the T-cell therapy against COVID-19.","tags":null,"title":"Single-cell transcriptome landscape and antigen receptor dynamic during SARS-CoV-2 vaccination","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Spatial-domain is a process that uses STAGATE to find spatial domain.\n","date":1645747200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1645747200,"objectID":"5b9115669486ae7ed6ce3d6dfc9de60b","permalink":"https://gouxiaojuan.github.io/project/spatial-domain/","publishdate":"2022-02-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/spatial-domain/","section":"project","summary":"Spatial-domain is a process that uses STAGATE to find spatial domain.","tags":["Python pipeline"],"title":"Spatial-domain","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"SVG is a process that uses sptialDE to find spatially variable genes.\n","date":1645747200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1645747200,"objectID":"c5933b8adb090b1bd5eca42dc6e3f5b5","permalink":"https://gouxiaojuan.github.io/project/svg/","publishdate":"2022-02-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/svg/","section":"project","summary":"SVG is a process that uses sptialDE to find spatially variable genes.","tags":["Python pipeline"],"title":"SVG","type":"project"},{"authors":["Yuan Lu","Wenbo He","Xin Huang","Yu He","Xiaojuan Gou","Xiaoke Liu","Zhe Hu","Weize Xu","Khaista Rahman","Shan Li","Sheng Hu","Jie Luo","Prof.Gang Cao"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1639008000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1639008000,"objectID":"90802a85430eded42e8b0409126aa7dc","permalink":"https://gouxiaojuan.github.io/publication/strategies-to-package-recombinant-adeno-associated-virus-expressing-the-n-terminal-gasdermin-domain-for-tumor-treatment/","publishdate":"2021-12-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/strategies-to-package-recombinant-adeno-associated-virus-expressing-the-n-terminal-gasdermin-domain-for-tumor-treatment/","section":"publication","summary":"Pyroptosis induced by the N-terminal gasdermin domain (GSDMNT) holds great potential for anti-tumor therapy. However, due to the extreme cytoxicity of GSDMNT, it is challenging to efficiently produce and deliver GSDMNT into tumor cells. Here, we report the development of two strategies to package recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) expressing GSDMNT 1) drive the expression of GSDMNT by a mammal specific promoter and package the virus in Sf9 insect cells to avoid its expression; 2) co-infect rAAV-Cre to revert and express the double-floxed inverted GSDMNT. We demonstrate that these rAAVs can induce pyroptosis and prolong survival in preclinical cancer models. The oncolytic-viruses induce pyroptosis and evoke a robust immune-response. In a glioblastoma model, rAAVs temporarily open the blood-brain barrier and recruit tumor infiltrating lymphocytes into the brain. The oncolytic effect is further improved in combination with anti-PD-L1. Together, our strategies efficiently produce and deliver GSDMNT into tumor cells and successfully induce pyroptosis, which can be exploited for anti-tumor therapy.","tags":null,"title":"Strategies to package recombinant Adeno-Associated Virus expressing the N-terminal gasdermin domain for tumor treatment","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\nFeatures Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides Controls Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34; if porridge == \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34;: print(\u0026#34;Eating...\u0026#34;) Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}} Press Space to play!\nOne\rTwo\rThree\rA fragment can accept two optional parameters:\nclass: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}} Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\nOnly the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view Themes black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026#34;/media/boards.jpg\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026#34;#0000FF\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026#34;my-style\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} Custom CSS Example Let’s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; } Questions?
