We developed a Single-cell Projectome-transcriptome In situ Deciphering Sequencing (SPIDER-Seq) technique by combining viral barcoding tracing with single-cell sequencing and spatial-omics. This empowers us to delineate a integrated single-cell spatial molecular, cellular, anatomic and projectomic atlas of mouse prefrontal cortex (PFC). The projectomic and transcriptomic cell clusters display distinct modular organization principles, but are coordinately configured in the PFC. The projection neurons gradiently occupied different territories in the PFC aligning with their wiring patterns. Importantly, they show higher co-projection probability to the downstream nuclei with reciprocal circuit connections. Moreover, we integrated projectomic atlas with their distinct spectrum of neurotransmitter/neuropeptide and the receptors-related gene profiles and depicted PFC neural signal transmission network. By which, we uncovered potential mechanisms underlying the complexity and specificity of neural transmission. Finally, leveraging machine learning, we predicted neuron projections with high accuracy by combining gene profiles and spatial information. As a proof of concept, we used this model to predict projections of fear recall engram neurons. This study facilitates our understanding of brain multi-modal network and neural computation.","tags":null,"title":"Organization of mouse prefrontal cortex subnetwork revealed by spatial single-cell multi-omic analysis of SPIDER-Seq","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tianyi Fei","Yu Dong","Xiaojuan Gou","Jiahao Zhang","Guangling Wang","Nini Yuan","Zhenkun Zhuang","Duoyuan Chen","Zihan Wu","Lijie Zhan","Ning Liang","Nicholas Mitsios","Jingfang Pan","Yafeng Zhan","Mengdi Cao","Ying Xia","Haotian Yan","Xiaojia Zhu","Yuzhe Huang","Shishuo Chen","Hao Yang","Liqin Gu","He Wang","Yanqing Zhong","Qian Yu","Yingjie An","Ruiqi Wang","Shenyu Li","Jingjing Song","Wanqiu Zhou","Shuzhen Zhang","Biyu Ren","Yanbing Lu","Wenqun Ding","Shuting Li","Huateng Cao","Junkai Lin","Yannong Dou","Xuyin Jiang","Chun Xie","Yan Li","Xing Tan","Yuanfang Xu","Xinxiang Song","Huanhuan Li","Mengni Chen","Shiwen Wang","Mingyuan Zheng","Jiao Fang","Ruiyi Zhang","Qinwen Chai","Mingli Wang","Li Li","Taosha Gao","Liuqin Qian","Chenxi Jin","Jiawen Huang","Wei Deng","Minghai Li","Chao Li","Zhiyong Liu","Zhifeng Liang","Shengjin Xu","Mathias Uhlén","Mu-Ming Poo","Jianhua Yao","Shiping Liu","Cirong Liu","Zhiming Shen","Yan-Gang Sun","Chengyu T Li","Jan Mulder","Prof. Gang Cao","Yidi Sun","Chun Xu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1767312000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1767312000,"objectID":"8c9c9b96e1704145ce8264fc794df9da","permalink":"https://gouxiaojuan.github.io/publication/evolutionary-convergence-and-divergence-of-hippocampal-cytoarchitecture-between-rodents-and-primates-revealed-by-single-cell-spatial-transcriptomics/","publishdate":"2026-01-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/evolutionary-convergence-and-divergence-of-hippocampal-cytoarchitecture-between-rodents-and-primates-revealed-by-single-cell-spatial-transcriptomics/","section":"publication","summary":"The hippocampus comprises subregions of distinct cell types critical for memory and cognition, but their gene expression profiles and spatial distribution patterns remain to be clarified. Using single-cell spatial transcriptomic analysis and single-nucleus RNA sequencing, we obtained transcriptome-based atlases for the macaque, marmoset, and mouse hippocampus. Cross-species comparison revealed primate- and lamina-specific glutamatergic cell types in the subicular complex, as well as enrichment of VIP-expressing GABAergic cells from mice to primates, including humans. Furthermore, we found reduced transcriptomic differences between CA3 and CA4 subregions and distinct longitudinal distributions of various cell types and expression of ion-channel genes, correlated with differences in electrophysiological properties of CA3, CA4, and CA1 neurons revealed by slice recording from marmosets and mice.

The bulk TCR sequencing analysis of COVID-19 patients was also performed. Enrichment of a clonal CD8+ T cell cluster expressing specific TCR was identified in both vaccination candidates and COVID-19 patients. These clonal CD8+ T cells showed high expression of cytotoxicity, phagosome and antigen presentation related genes. The cell–cell interaction analysis revealed that monocytes and dendritic cells could interact with these cells and initiate phagocytosis via ICAM1-ITGAM and ITGB2 signaling.

However, due to the extreme cytoxicity of GSDMNT, it is challenging to efficiently produce and deliver GSDMNT into tumor cells. Here, we report the development of two strategies to package recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) expressing GSDMNT 1) drive the expression of GSDMNT by a mammal specific promoter and package the virus in Sf9 insect cells to avoid its expression; 2) co-infect rAAV-Cre to revert and express the double-floxed inverted GSDMNT. We demonstrate that these rAAVs can induce pyroptosis and prolong survival in preclinical cancer models. The oncolytic-viruses induce pyroptosis and evoke a robust immune-response. In a glioblastoma model, rAAVs temporarily open the blood-brain barrier and recruit tumor infiltrating lymphocytes into the brain. The oncolytic effect is further improved in combination with anti-PD-L1. Together, our strategies efficiently produce and deliver GSDMNT into tumor cells and successfully induce pyroptosis, which can be exploited for anti-tumor therapy.","tags":null,"title":"Strategies to package recombinant Adeno-Associated Virus expressing the N-terminal gasdermin domain for tumor treatment","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"This website is a personal academic homepage.\nNo personal data are collected, stored, or processed through this website.
